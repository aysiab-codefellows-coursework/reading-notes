### Partials 
Since the article was short, I'm just going to share my discussion and thoughts of the article. Partials from what the article made it seem, are a great way to further template using EJS. They make HTML easily accessible and reusable across your webpage. A partial is essentially a partial yet consistent HTML piece of your webpage stored alone in it's own file; the example in the article was of a header and footer. 

Using EJS syntax of `<%- include() %>`, you can then 'call' your partial to that page. I can see how this can makes sites look clean, consistent and behave similarly among pages. Easily had my mind blown, because I often wondered if there was an easy way to repeat HTML chunks across pages.
