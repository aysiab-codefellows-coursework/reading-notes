### Review, Research & Discuss
> 1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
- better program design 
- higher quality code 
- code flexibility & easier maintenance down the road

> 2. In what case would you need to use `beforeEach()` and `afterEach()` in a test suite?
- If you are repeating a lot of the same processes for your tests. This reduces redundancy in your test suites. 

> 3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development?
- Because it can require a lot of time and effort upfront to produce well written tests, development can seem slow, or the original tests written are too simple and may later lead to code needing to be refactored. 

> 4. What's the primary difference ebtween ES6 Classes and Constructor/Protoype Classes?
- Inheritance works differently since ES6  classes can extend to other classes. Class Cat can exend Class Animal and have access to everything Animal does. 

> 5. Why REST?
- REST follows a very standard protocol and relies on HTTP which therefore makees it simple for computer systems to send information around from each other.

### Definitions
1. Functional programming: treats code computation similar to a mathematical equation. It is non mutable. 
2. Object-oriented programming: has 4 main pillars (encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism)
3. Class: is a template for data structures to be built from. 
4. `super`: refers back to the parent class 
5. `this`: refers to the object being created directly within a constructor function 
6. Jest: industry standard JS test suite 
7. Continous Integration (CI): a standard for impelementing code continuously throughout the entire development process. Usually paired with continuous deployment (CD).
8. REST: Short for Representational State Transfer. Works with HTTP and is responsible for the client-server relationship. 
9. Data Model: a visual of code request, response cycle.
