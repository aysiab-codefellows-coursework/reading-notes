# Reading Assignment 11


### Review Research & Discussion
> 1. Why is access control important?
- Access control protects data from unauthorized users. 

> 2. Describe an application that would need access control.
- When I worked retail for Microsoft, sales associates couldn't access the inventory and recieving information, and the inventory control couldn't access sales metrics. 

> 3. What is a role used for?
- For creating access control amongst users in the application; ie. only some users are able to use xyz feature or do xyz things. 

> 4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary ormandatory access control?
- Role based access control is more scalable because when you are editing the rights to roles, it gets edited to the role itself rather than editing every individual user right.
