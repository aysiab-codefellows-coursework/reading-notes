# Stacks & Queues
- [Stacks & Queues](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/stacks_and_queues.html)

### Stacks
- A stack is a data structure that follows the "First In Last Out"/"Last In First Out" principles. A stack typically has a property top that accounts for the node at the top of the stack.

- A stack typically has the following methods:
    - `.push(value)` adds a value to the top of the stack
    - `.pop()` removes the value at the top of the stack and returns it
    - `.peek()` returns the value at the top of the stack
    - `isEmpty()` returns a boolean regarding if the stack is empty or contains nodes

### Queues
- A queue is a data structure that follows the opposite principles of a stack "First In First Out"/"Last In Last Out". A queue typically has the properties front and rear that account for the front Node and the rear Node of the queue. 

- A queue typically has the following methods:
    - `.enqueue(value)` adds a value to the rear of the queue 
    - `.dequeue()` removes the value at the front of the queue and returns it
    - `.peek()` returns the value at the front of the queue.
    - `.isEmpty()` returns a boolean regarding if the queue is empty or contains nodes
