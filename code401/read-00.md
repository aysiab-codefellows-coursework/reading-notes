## Focus & Problem Solving: The Common Thread
All four articles had a common theme revolving around how to properly focus and problem solve. 

The Simple Programmer Article walks the reader through how to problem solve technical and algorithmic coding questions. Rather than jumping right into attempting to write code, the author John Somnez urges the reader to focus and break down what the problem domain is first. By doing this, a person can more effectively answer a technical interview question because it helps them allocate their time to answer the question better. 

The Medium article talks about how busyness differs from focus. Most people consider themselves busy, however being busy does not equate to focused and productive. Often times 'busyness' actually leads to unhappiness and resentment because all that busyness was for naught. Remembering that one's time is precious and acting like your time is worth '$1000/hr' can lead to a person doing more *deep work*:

> "Deep work means absolutely not tolerating distractions and producing monumental quality and quantity in a very short time."

Furthermore, the FreeCodeCamp article also relates back to the Simple Programmer article on the concept of effective problem solving. The article speaks of how trying a solution, rinse, wash, repeat until luck comes through isn't the most effective way to problem solve, and really isn't a way to problem solve at all. FreeCodeCamp reccommends starting with understanding the problem (just like the Simple Programmer), and then forming plan of action. By this point, the plan of action can then be divided up into smaller parts making the overall solution more managable. 

Mind Tools also had an article about problem solving revolving around the 5 Whys technique. Similarily, the Mind Tools article begins with assembling a team familiar with the issue and defining the problem. The next step involves asking '5 whys' about why the problem is occurring. Doing these in succession will help find the root of the issue. At which point, then you can address the issues directly.
