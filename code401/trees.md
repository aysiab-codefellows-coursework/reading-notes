### Trees

### Binary Trees
- Binary Trees are a data structure that are a connection of nodes. These data structures are contructed with a root property that points to the first node inserted which is the node at the very top of the tree. 

*What makes a Binary Tree different from any other tree structure?*
- Binary Trees are different in a way that ensures that every node can only have two children; a right child and a left child. 

*What makes a* ***Binary Search Tree*** *different from a Binary Tree?*
- A Binary Search Tree adds nodes differentlty than a Binary Tree. Child nodes that are lesser value than the parent node get placed to the left side of the parent node, and child nodes that greater value than the parent node get placed to the right of the parent. 

*How do you traverse a Binary Tree?*
- There a several ways to traverse through a binary tree; either through a breadth first search or a depth first search.
    - There are 3 common orderings for depth first searches:
    1. PreOrder: root, left child, right child 
    2. InOrder: left child, root, right child
    3. PostOrder: left child, right child, root
