### SEO: Search Engine Optimization 
Say you know how to build a website now, but do you know how to maximize your website's visibility? That's where SEO coes in handy. 

Search Engine Optimizaion is the practice of trying to get your site near the top of search engine results when people search for things that your website covers. The basics of SEO really comes down to trying to pinpoint key terms that are strongly associated with your site and where to appropriately place them on your webpage for search engines to notice them. This is considered an *on-page technique*. 

*Off-page techniques* on the other hand take into consideration the number of sites that linke ot your webpage. 

For the intents and purposes of this article, we are going to dive deep into what to consider for *on-page techniques*. 

Every page of your website has **seven** places that are ideal to place your page's key buzz words. 

1. Page Title
    - the page title is the title that appears at the top of your browser or within the browser tab
2. URL/Web Address
    - the name of the file for the page is apart of the URL
3. Headings
    - search engines will consider the heading text with greater weight
4. Text
    - repeat your key words 2-3 times in a body of text *if possible*. You want your text to still read naturally to your fellow human readers. 
5. Link Text
    - use keywords appropriately to link between your pages; limit generic link names. 
6. Image Alt Text
    - alt text is supposed to supply accurate descriptions of your images; search engines rely on the alt text to display images from your site in image searches
7. Page Descriptions 
    - descriptions are meta text like your title that search engines also parse for keywords

Brainstorming and identifying your keywords for your website is one of the toughest parts about SEO. When brainstorming, ask other people what terms they would use to find your site. These terms are often to be more reflective of a real life case than maybe what you thought of (there is less likely to be industry jargon that makes little sense to a real life consumer). 

Futhermore, it is important to group your keywords together to be used for separate pages or areas of your website. If you are a multi-service salon maybe you have a page/category all about nails and another all about hair services. 

This organization will be helpful for mapping your keywords onto your site. Not all keywords will be used on every single page of your site, in fact it is likely that keywords will get more specific the farther away from the homepage you get as each page gets more specific. 

After you've initially set up your SEO, you will want to keep track of your analytics. Analytics are a way to gauge where traffic to your site is coming from, and further let your continuously refine your SEO.
